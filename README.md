This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
## TASK to Complete
This is a very basic unstyled version of an advert detail page based upon content on our Caravans for Sale website (https://www.caravansforsale.co.uk/Conventional/coachman-2022-laser-575-extra-4-berth-2021-touring-caravan/1443761)- the page routing structure has been recreated here and can be accessed via: http://localhost:3000/Conventional/coachman-2022-laser-575-extra-4-berth-2021-touring-caravan/1443761 - To keep this task focused on styling / front end approach a basic the API call has been mocked for simplicity.

The challenge is to make this page look similar or even better than the Caravans for Sale advert details pages on the live site (it doesn't need to an exact copy but similar styling / theming), whilst utilizing all the NextJS coding practices, patterns, CSS, libraries and tools you like to make the page the best it can be.
Please keep the following in mind:
